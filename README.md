# About Me:
Hi, I’m Tiago. From a young age, I loved taking things apart to see how they worked and building my own creations. That curiosity led me to programming: first HTML at school, then C from a book my father had, and eventually Python, Java, Julia, Rust, and TypeScript. I’m now focused on Rust and TypeScript, with plans to dive into Swift in the future.

I enjoy systems programming—writing the backbone of apps, frameworks, websites, and dashboards. Some of my notable projects include **Alex**, which evolved through multiple languages and iterations, and **Avi**, a personal assistant I rebuilt in Rust as a school project. I’ve also built websites and dashboards for my school, church, and other community projects.

Outside of code, I’m passionate about God, reading, brainstorming, spending time with my girlfriend, and diving into stories—from **How to Train Your Dragon** to **Pacific Rim**, **Avatar**, Marvel, and **The Wild Robot**. These worlds inspire my creativity and problem-solving.

My approach to programming is simple: make it run, refactor, make it better, and make it beautiful—both in code aesthetics and UI design. I also had the honor of being a programmer for the **FIRST Global Team of Cape Verde** in the 2025 edition, which was an incredible experience.

I love taking challenges head-on, exploring new technologies, and building projects that combine functionality, elegance, and creativity.
